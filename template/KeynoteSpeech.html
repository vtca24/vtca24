            <p align="justify">
                A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructure-less wireless network consisting of self-configured mobile nodes. The mobile nodes in a MANET can communicate dynamically without using any router or access point. The mobile nodes forward their data to their neighbors and form an on-the-fly network. MANET is used in various real-time applications, such as e-voting, army tactical communication, healthcare applications, disaster rescue, online message exchange, etc. However, source authentication and deniability are essential properties in such applications. These properties can be addressed using a deniable authentication (DA) protocol. In a DA protocol, a mobile node (receiver) can directly verify the source mobile node of a message without consulting a trusted third party. The literature has designed various DA protocols, called PKC-DA, based on the certificate authority-based public key cryptography (CA-PKC) that utilizes a public key infrastructure (PKI). The PKI is used to issue, store, deliver, and revoke the public key certificates of the mobile nodes. However, these protocols suffer from certificate management issues. Identity-based Cryptography (IBC) is used to construct DA protocols to mitigate this issue. Identity-based deniable authentication (IBDA) protocols eliminated the need of PKI. This talk will discuss some recently proposed IBDA protocols, their security issues, mitigation strategies, and security analysis methods.<br>
