                A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructure-less wireless network consisting of self-configured mobile nodes. The mobile nodes in a MANET can communicate dynamically without using any router or access point. The mobile nodes forward their data to their neighbors and form an on-the-fly network. MANET is used in various real-time applications, such as e-voting, army tactical communication, healthcare applications, disaster rescue, online message exchange, etc. However, source authentication and deniability are essential properties in such applications. These properties can be addressed using a deniable authentication (DA) protocol. In a DA protocol, a mobile node (receiver) can directly verify the source mobile node of a message without consulting a trusted third party. The literature has designed various DA protocols, called PKC-DA, based on the certificate authority-based public key cryptography (CA-PKC) that utilizes a public key infrastructure (PKI). The PKI is used to issue, store, deliver, and revoke the public key certificates of the mobile nodes. However, these protocols suffer from certificate management issues. Identity-based Cryptography (IBC) is used to construct DA protocols to mitigate this issue. Identity-based deniable authentication (IBDA) protocols eliminated the need of PKI. This talk will discuss some recently proposed IBDA protocols, their security issues, mitigation strategies, and security analysis methods.<br>

            <p align="justify">
                Image semantic segmentation is an interdisciplinary research direction involving computer vision, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. It is a key scientific issue in applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent monitoring, virtual reality, medical image diagnosis, and robotics. At present, deep learning has made significant breakthroughs in the field of image semantic segmentation. However, a large number of pixel level annotations typically require a significant amount of time, money, and manpower. Therefore, the insufficient or missing training data has become one of the key factors restricting the further development of image semantic segmentation.
                In order to reduce the huge burden of pixel level annotation, many weakly supervised image semantic segmentation techniques have been proposed in recent years, which utilize a large amount of easily obtainable weakly supervised information (such as image labels) to complete more complex image semantic segmentation tasks.
                Interactive semantic segmentation is an important technical means to reduce the cost of pixel level annotation by guiding computers to achieve fast and accurate object segmentation through simple human-computer interaction.
                This report will introduce some research works of my research group in weakly supervised image semantic segmentation and interactive image segmentation.<br>
